# Notus Labs

We are a Turkey-based tech lab focused on the development  and design of blockchain projects. With our team and toolkits,  we can create user-friendly Web3 projects.

## Notus

Notus is a decentralized L1 blockchain platform. It aims to solve the problems of scalability and security that current blockchain platforms face.

The platform employs a new consensus mechanism, called Proof of Randomness (PoR), to address the problems created by previous solutions. This system is highly efficient, can process thousands of transactions per second, and makes the network very secure. The network's design also allows for massive scaling—there are no limits on how many users it can support

It also has a native token ($NOTUS) where users can buy and sell goods/services using Notus coins.
