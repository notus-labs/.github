# Notus Labs

Notus Labs is a laboratory for developing the Notus project, which consists of tools to build a distributed system for managing the network.

## Notus

Notus is a decentralized L1 blockchain platform. It aims to solve the problems of scalability and security that current blockchain platforms face.

The platform employs a new consensus mechanism, called Proof-of- Randomness (PoR), to address the problems created by previous solutions. This system is highly efficient, can process thousands of transactions per second, and makes the network very secure. The network's design also allows for massive scalingâ€”there are no limits on how many users it can support

It also has a native token ($NOTUS) where users can buy and sell goods/services using Notus coins.
